        Escriba Word Processor for OS/2 Presentation Manager
       ======================================================

  This program provides a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) word 
processor for the OS/2 Presentation Manager interface.  It does not attempt
to go head-to-head with the large professional word processors available 
for OS/2 PM or Windows, but rather tries to provide a more modest set of 
functions.  Normal text formatting is provided for, plus the program has 
the ability to handle embedded graphics.  All installed ATM fonts are 
supported, in all the native formats and in a wide range of sizes.  Printer
support is strictly through the OS/2 PM interface, providing output on any 
printer supported by that interface, including FAX and plotter devices.

        Installation
        ------------

  To install Escriba, you must execute the command-file 'ENGLISH'.  You 
will be asked in what directory you wish to install the program.  Please 
enter the full path of that directory, including the drive specifier.  If 
the directory does not exist, it will be created. Once you have entered the
directory name, the installation will complete. The program's EXE, DLL, HLP
and DOC files will be copied to the target directory.  A folder will be 
created on your desktop and a program object will be placed therein.  In 
addition, an object to represent the DOC file will be placed there.  Once 
installation is complete, feel free to move the objects wherever you wish.

  If by chance you delete any of the objects, simply repeat the 
installation procedure.  The program settings will not be lost.


        Translations
        ------------

  Escriba is built to be translatable into other languages easily.  The 
Spanish, French, German and Dutch versions have already been translated.  
If you wish to translate the program to your native language, send me a 
note to my Internet ID (rpapo@msen.com) or to my mailing address. I will 
send you the texts that need to be translated (the help file, the 
documentation file, the installation script and the text resource 
definitions). Once I have the translated material back, I will add the new 
language to the next release of the word processor.  Keep in mind, however,
that I will always be asking you for updates as the program gets revised 
and enhanced.  In return for your help, your registration is free and you 
will get free upgrades as long as you continue to translate them.

  The translators responsible for the existing versions are:
