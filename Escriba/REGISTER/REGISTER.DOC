- - - Documentation for the Escriba Registration module - - -

Though all who have paid for their Escriba registrations
will receive two complete copies of the program on
diskette, and the printed manual once I have made it,
I do not want you to have to choose between using an
older, registered copy of the program and a newer,
unregistered copy.  For this reason I have created
a special DLL file for you.  This DLL contains your
name, your registration serial number and some
verification information.  Place the file in the
same directory where Escriba is installed, or in any
directory in your LIBPATH, and Escriba will recognize
you are registered when you go to display the
Product Information (About) dialog.
